# pulmonary-fibrosis-progression-prediction
This project explores the use of multimodal data (pulmonary scans images +  clinical features) to predict the progression of the lung capacity in patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

## Objectives
The target feature to predict is FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) at un certain week with a level of confidence.
- Analyze and preprocess heterogeneous medical data (images + tables)
- Build a multimodal model (CNN + MLP) to estimate progression of FVC
- Apply training with optimize parameters
- Evaluate the model
